    <p class="container white p3 h2 fw100">We believe as Christians we are called to serve God “out of a heart of gratitude” for what he has done for us. God has invited us to participate with him in what he is doing redeeming our community, culture, and world. Our service is our expression of love toward God. We at Sunrise encourage one another to participate in this ministry in a variety of ways; inside the church, and out in the community.</p>

      <h2 class="h1 mb0">Sunrise Congregational Care</h2>
      <p>Sunrise Church takes seriously the Biblical mandate to live in community and care for one another’s needs. Those needs may be spiritual, social, physical, financial or emotional. We have a very active corps of deacons and assistant deacons. Our Deacons oversee all of our issues of stewardship and benevolence. Our Assistant Deacons lead ministries that are targeting service toward:</p>
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>Our Senior members</li>
      <li>Financial needs of our members – Congregational Care Fund</li>
      <li>Community Outreach – Community Care Fund</li>
      <li>Work Teams – serving inside our family and in our community</li>

      <h2 class="h1 mb0">Yamhill County Gospel Rescue Mission</h2>
      <p>In 2007 the YCGRM received a building and opened for “business.” The YCGRM is a shelter for homeless women and children or homeless single men looking for temporary shelter. The YCGRM ministers to families in transition or people living on the streets who need a warm meal and dry place to sleep. The mission of the YCGRM is “TO PROVIDE FOOD, SHELTER & HOPE FOR THE SOUL THROUGH THE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST.” We encourage one another to take seriously Jesus’ message in Matthew 25:35 when he said, “For I was hungry, and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty…</p>

<p>…and you gave Me something to drink;I was a stranger, and you invited Me in… Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of these brothers of Mine, even the least of them, you did it to Me.” YCGRM is just one way we encourage one another to fulfill Jesus’ call to serve him as we serve the “least of these.”</p>

      <h2 class="h1 mb0">Monthly Ministry Focus for Sunrise Church</h2>
      <p>To ensure that our service and giving is intentionally dispersed within our congregation, into our community and around the world, we have adopted a Monthly Ministry Calendar. This calendar helps keep our focus from becoming too unbalanced and gives us a lot of exposure to many different ministry and service opportunities.</p>

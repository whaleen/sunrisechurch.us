<p>
What Can I Expect if I Attend a Sunrise Church Worship Service?
</p>

<p>
  At Sunrise Church you will find a group of people who are seeking to live authentically as those rescued by God’s grace through the saving work of Jesus Christ. We have a commitment to Christ and his church, thus we take seriously our love for one another. At Sunrise Church the fellowship is deeply fulfilling for those who apply themselves to it. During your visit we hope that you sense our love for the Lord, our love for one another, and most of all, God’s never-failing love for his people!
</p>


<p>
  We believe that as Christians we should offer our best in service to the Lord. Yet, we also believe that the Christian life is about God’s grace, not our human performance. Therefore, you may notice that Sunrise Church is not very “polished.” You won’t find a lot of flash or glitz. We are not trying to “put on a show.” Instead, we desire that our worship, preaching and fellowship will be God-centered, Biblical and lead to authentic worship of the Lord Jesus in spirit and in truth.
